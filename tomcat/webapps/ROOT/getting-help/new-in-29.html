	<li>A <em>major new tool called Lessons</em>, through which instructors can consolidate course materials, assignments, quizzes, discussion forums, and multimedia while presenting all such items within a structure that mirrors the actual flow of the course; and</li>
	<li><em>Enhancements to commonly used Sakai tools</em>, such as Forums, Gradebook, and Tests & Quizzes.</li>
      </ol>

	    <p>Users can directly navigate to a tool or page within a site through drop down menus accessed by clicking on the down arrow now present in the corresponding site tab.</p>

	    <p>Users can click a tab affixed to the tool menu in order to minimize it and thus expand the size of the tool view within the web browser.</p>

	    <h4 id="hidden_pages">Hidden pages</h4>
	    <p>The tool menu readily distinguishes pages in the site that instructors have hidden from students by greying-out site these pages and displaying the page title with italics.</p>
	    
	    <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/HiddenPages.png" title="Figure 1.5: Hidden pages are grayed-out and italicized in the tool menu. In this example an instructor has hidden several pages from students (e.g., Site Info, Assignments, Tests &amp; Quizzes, Roster, Resources, and Forums).

	    <p>In previous versions of Sakai, instructors had to either “View Site as Student” or navigate to the the Page Order view of Site Info to assess which pages are hidden from students.</p>
	    
	    <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/PageOrderButton.png" title="Figure 1.6: To hide pages from students in your site, first navigate to Site Info and then click 'Page Order.'"><img src="./img/tn_PageOrderButton.png" alt="Figure 1.6: To hide pages from students in your site, first navigate to Site Info and then click 'Page Order.'" /></a></p>

	    <p>Instructors can hide pages (or show them again) by toggling the light bulb icon in the Page Order view of Site Info.</p>

	    <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/PageOrderView.png" title="Figure 1.7: Instructors can hide pages by toggling the light bulb icons from yellow to white in the 'Page Order' view.

		<h5 id="lock_pages">Lock pages</h5>
		<p>The 'Page Order' function in Site Info now includes a lock feature.</p>
		
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/SiteInfo_PageOrderLock.png" title="Figure 3.1: Lock icons in the 'Page Order' view of Site Info."><img src="./img/tn_SiteInfo_PageOrderLock.png" alt="Figure 3.1: Lock icons in the 'Page Order' view of Site Info." /></a></p>
		<p>Locking a page not only hides a page from students but also disables it from student access. 'Lock' differs from 'Hide.' 'Hide' simply hides a page like Assignments from students; however, students can still interact with actual assignments from Assignments indirectly through the Lessons tool. Locking the Assignments page prevents all student access, including indirect access through Lessons.</p>
	      </div>
	      
	      <div class="chunk">
		<h5 id="site_language">Site language</h5>
		<p>The language for a site can be changed from the default, 'English (United States)'. This can be useful for some language courses. (Unfortunately, language support in Sakai does not extend to German and Norwegian.) To change the language for a site, click 'Edit Site Information' in the Site Info tool.</p>	      
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/SiteInfo_EditSiteInformation.png" title="Figure 3.2: The 'Edit Site Information' button in Site Info."><img src="./img/tn_SiteInfo_EditSiteInformation.png" alt="Figure 3.2: The 'Edit Site Information' button in Site Info." /></a></p>

	      </ul>

	      <h5 id="zip_files">ZIP files</h5>
	      <p>As an alternative to <a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=aqyy" target="_blank">WebDAV</a> for uploading or downloading multiple files at a time, instructors can upload ZIP files (*.zip) and extract their contents. However, all files uploaded through Resources including ZIP files must be less than 100 Mb. (Otherwise, instructors can use <a href="/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=aqyy" target="_blank">WebDAV</a> to bypass this upload limit.)</p>
	    
	      <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Resources_ZipFile.png" title="Figure 3.4: ZIP files are uploaded to Resources like any other file.

From the 'Add' menu of any folder, select 'Upload Files'. Also, depicted is an example ZIP file, 'TextFiles.zip,' that had been uploaded." /></a></p>
	      <p>Extract the contents of a ZIP file by selecting 'Extract ZIP Archive Contents' from the file's corresponding 'Actions' menu.</p>
	      <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Resources_ExpandedZipFile.png" title="Figure 3.5: The 'Extract ZIP Archive Contents' menu item."><img src="./img/tn_Resources_ExpandedZipFile.png" alt="Figure 3.5: The 'Extract ZIP Archive Contents' menu item." /></a></p>
	      <p>The ZIP file is retained after its contents are extracted.</p>

	      <p>Likewise, Resources allows instructors to compress a folder and its content, including the root Resources folder for a site. This is useful for  downloading multiple files without having to use WebDAV.</p>
	      <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Resources_CompressFolder.png" title="Figure 3.7: The 'Compress to ZIP Archive' menu item."><img src="./img/tn_Resources_CompressFolder.png" alt="Figure 3.7: The 'Compress to ZIP Archive' menu item." /></a></p>  
	      <p>Note that compressing a folder to produce a ZIP file does not remove the original folder and its contents from Resources.</p>

	    </ul>
	    <div class="chunk">
	      <h5 id="behalf">Instructors can submit assignments on behalf of students</h5>
	      <p>Assignments now provides instructors the ability to submit an assignment on behalf of a student. This feature can be useful for exceptional circumstances when a student needs to submit an assignment through a channel outside of the Assignments tool, whether via email, Sakai&apos;s Drop Box tool, etc. With this feature, the instructor can corral stray assignments and attribute them to the proper students without requiring the students' intervention.</p>
	      <p>To use this feature, go to the &apos;Assignment List&apos; and in the drop-down menu labeled &apos;View,&apos; and select &apos;Assignment List by Student.&apos;</p>
	      <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Assignments_AssignmentListByStudent.png" title="Figure 3.9: To access the feature for submitting assignments on behalf of students, change the 'View' of the 'Assignment List' to 'Assignment List by Student'."><img src="./img/tn_Assignments_AssignmentListByStudent.png" alt="Figure 3.9: To access the feature for submitting assignments on behalf of students, change the 'View' of the 'Assignment List'to 'Assignment List by Student'." /></a></p>
	      <p>Proceed by clicking the 'Submit as Student' link for the particular student for the particular assignment of interest.</p>
	      <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Assignments_SubmitAsStudentLink.png" title="Figure 3.10: Click on the toggle arrow by a student's name to view assignments attributed to them.

Then click the 'Submit as Student' link for a particular assignment." /></a></p>
	      <p>Then upload the student's assignment and submit.</p>
	      <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Assignments_SubmitOnBehalfOfStudent.png" title="Figure 3.11: 1. Verify that you are submitting for the correct assignment. 2.

	      <p>Note that though the submission is attributed to the intended student for grading, etc., Assignments will track and display who actually performed the submission.</p>
	      <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Assignments_SubmittedBy.png" title="Figure 3.12: For assignments on behalf of students, the submission date in the 'Submitted' column of the 'Submissions' view will include the name of the instructor who submitted the assignment."><img src="./img/tn_Assignments_SubmittedBy.png" alt="Figure 3.12: For assignments on behalf of students, the submission date in the 'Submitted' column of the 'Submissions' view will include the name of the instructor who submitted the assignment." /></a></p>

	      <h5 id="turnitin">Turnitin options</h5>
	      <p>The <a href="http://www.plu.edu/itech/itech/turnitin.php" target="_blank">Turnitin Service</a> settings in Assignments have changed such that the option for 'Allow students to view report' is not visible as a setting until the 'Use Turnitin' checkbox is checked.</p>
	      <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Assignments_Options.png" title="Figure 3:13: 'Use Turnitin' checkbox."><img src="./img/tn_Assignments_Options.png" alt="Figure 3:13: 'Use Turnitin' checkbox." /></a></p>
	      <p>Furthermore, many more Turnitin options are presented in Sakai 2.9. Except for checking 'Allow students to view report' to grant student's access to the originality checking report, most instructors would leave the remaining settings as-is.</p>
	      <!-- p>You can find details on what each setting is for in the QuickStart <a href="/access/content/group/Support/documents/UsingTurnitin.pdf" target="_blank">Using Turnitin</a>.</p -->
	      <p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Assignments_TurnitinOptions.png" title="Figure: 3.14: 'Allow students to view report' is likely the only Turnitin Service option that instructors would want to change from the default settings."><img src="./img/tn_Assignments_TurnitinOptions.png" alt="Figure: 3.14: 'Allow students to view report' is likely the only Turnitin Service option that instructors would want to change from the default settings." /></a></p>

	      <div class="chunk">
		<h5 id="topic_views">Revisions to topic and 'thread' views</h5>
		<p>Throughout the Forums tool, the previously used term 'thread' has been replaced with the term 'conversation.' For example, in the topic view in Forums, the phrase 'Post New Thread' is supplanted with 'Start a New Conversation.' Furthermore, the function 'Start a New Conversation' is displayed more prominently than before. It is now a button along the top of the topic view. Also, the topic view button formerly known as 'Display Entire Message' is now known as 'Display Message Content.' Instructors might also notice that the 'Topic Settings' and 'Delete Topic' buttons in the topic view are new in Sakai 2.9.</p>
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Forums_TopicView.png" title="Figure 3.15: An example of a topic view in Forums.

From the perspective of an instructor, more functions are arrayed as buttons across the top of the topic view in Sakai 2.9." /></a></p>
		<p>The conversation view in Forums has similarly been revised. Besides supplanting the term 'thread' with 'conversation,' the button formerly known as 'Reply to Thread' is now known as 'Reply to Initial Message.'</p>
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Forums_ConversationView.png" title="Figure 3.16: An example of a conversation view in Forums."><img src="./img/tn_Forums_ConversationView.png" alt="Figure 3.16: An example of a conversation view in Forums." /></a></p>
	      </div>

	      <div class="chunk">
		<h5 id="grade_entry">Improved grade entry</h5>
		<p>As in previous versions of Sakai, before an instructor can enter forum-related grades through the Forums tool, the instructor must first create one or more gradebook items in the Gradebook tool as appropriate for the task at hand.</p>
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Forums_GradebookItems.png" title="Figure: 3.17: Depicted in this Gradebook landing page are three gradebook items for Forums, associated with a gradebook category called 'Discussions.' New gradebook items can be added through the 'Add Gradebook Item(s)' button."><img src="./img/tn_Forums_GradebookItems.png" alt="Figure: 3.17: Depicted in this Gradebook landing page are three gradebook items for Forums, associated with a gradebook category called 'Discussions.' New gradebook items can be added through the 'Add Gradebook Item(s)' button." /></a></p>
		<p><em>(Tip: Ensure that the &apos;Release this item to Students&apos; checkbox for the forum-related gradebook items in Gradebook are not checked before you enter their corresponding grades in Forums. Otherwise, students will receive these grades while you are in the process of grading. Consequently, some students will see their grades before others do, and students will be able to observe changes to their grades if you revise them while in the midst of grading. After you have finished grading, then you can safely release those grades to students by checking &apos;Release this item to Students.&apos;)</em></p>
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Forums_EditGradebookItem.png" title="Figure: 3.18: The 'Release this item to Students' checkbox is depicted here as unchecked. You can find this checkbox either when adding a new gradebook item or when editing an existing item (by clicking the corresponding 'Edit' link on the Gradebook landing page)."><img src="./img/tn_Forums_EditGradebookItem.png" alt="Figure: 3.18: The 'Release this item to Students' checkbox is depicted here as unchecked. You can find this checkbox either when adding a new gradebook item or when editing an existing item (by clicking the corresponding 'Edit' link on the Gradebook landing page)." /></a></p>
		<p>Forums in Sakai 2.9 transcends a previous limitation which forced instructors to first navigate to a particular thread or conversation where the student had posted a message. From there the instructor would click the 'Grade' link associated with one of the student's posts to enter a grade.</p>
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Forums_GradeLinkForOneResponse.png" title="Figure: 3.19: To attribute a grade to a student in Forums, the instructor can click the 'Grade' link associated with a message posted by the student."><img src="./img/tn_Forums_GradeLinkForOneResponse.png" alt="Figure: 3.19: To attribute a grade to a student in Forums, the instructor can click the 'Grade' link associated with a message posted by the student." /></a></p>
		<p>(Note that in Sakai 2.9, clicking on the 'Grade' link in these views will popup a dialog instead of transporting the instructor to a separate view for entering a grade.)</p>
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Forums_GradingOneResponse1.png" title="Figure: 3.20: The top part of the popup dialog for grading a student's work. Note that the instructor can flexibly choose any gradebook item from the 'Gradebook Items' drop down menu."><img src="./img/tn_Forums_GradingOneResponse1.png" alt="Figure: 3.20: The top part of the popup dialog for grading a student's work.

		<p>Sakai 2.9 enables instructors to enter grades (e.g., for student participation) in close proximity to views for reviewing the students' overall participation. For example, instructors who want to review and grade overall student participation within a particular forum can do so by clicking on the 'Grade' link that's associated with the forum on the landing page of the Forums tool.</p>
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/Forums_BulkGradeForum.png" title="Figure: 3.22: To more easily grade all students' work within a forum, go to the Forums landing page. By the desired forum, click 'More' and then 'Grade.'"><img src="./img/tn_Forums_BulkGradeForum.png" alt="Figure: 3.22: To more easily grade all students' work within a forum, go to the Forums landing page. By the desired forum, click 'More' and then 'Grade.'" /></a></p>
		<p>Clicking on the 'Grade' link leads the instructor to a 'Statistics &amp; Grading' view for the forum. If a gradebook item was not defined in the 'Forum Settings' for that forum, a gradebook item can be selected as follows.</p>

		<p> In the appropriate column, enter the number of items in each category that you wish to drop or keep. You will notice that unavailable choices are grayed out. For example, you cannot both keep and drop items in the same category, so entering a number for one of these makes the other unavailable. Also note that when opting to drop or keep scores for a particular category, all the gradebook items in that category must share the same point values.</p>
		<p><em>Tip: Many faculty prefer to use Keep Highest as opposed to Drop Lowest, since it reflects a more accurate running total of student grades during the course of the academic term. Items that students have not yet completed are not dropped automatically, so one or more higher scores may be dropped until all items have been completed.</em></p>

		<p>The the Tests &amp; Quizzes landing page for instructors has been revised in Sakai 2.9 to more clearly distinguish its various contents. First, the choice between creating an assessment from scratch and importing one from an XML or ZIP file is now more apparent than before.</p>

		<p>Second, the display of assessments for the site is now structured using tabs. 'Working Copies' of assessments (formerly known as 'Pending Assessments') are more clearly contrasted against 'Published Assessments.' The former are not released to students while the published assessments have been released to students.</p>
		<p><a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="./img/TQ_LandingPageWorkingVsPublished.png" title="Figure 3.38: The tabbed display distinguishes 'Working Copies' of assessments (that are not released to students) from 'Published Copies' of assessments (published or released to students from original Working Copies)."><img src="./img/tn_TQ_LandingPageWorkingVsPublished.png" alt="Figure 3.38: The tabbed display distinguishes 'Working Copies' of assessments (that are not released to students) from 'Published Copies' of assessments (published or released to students from original Working Copies)." /></a></p>
